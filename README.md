This is a simple project that showcases how to interact with MongoDB using Rust programming language. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the official MongoDB driver for Rust.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Rust programming language (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- MongoDB server (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Install dependencies:

4. Save environment variable of your atlas key
 ```sh
 export MONGODB_URI="YOUR KEY"
 ```
5. Run the example  
 ```sh
cargo run
``` 


## Usage

The example demonstrates the following operations:

- Inserting documents into a MongoDB collection
- Querying documents from a collection
- Updating documents in a collection
- Deleting documents from a collection

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs. It provides a starting point for building Rust applications that interact with MongoDB.
